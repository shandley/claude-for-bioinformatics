## Content Transformation Strategy

### 1. Enhanced Educational Context
Transform reference material into learning-focused content:

**Before (Reference Style):**
```markdown
## SAM (.sam) / BAM (.bam)
- SAM: Sequence Alignment/Map (text format)
- BAM: Binary compressed version of SAM
- Tools: samtools, Picard, GATK
```

**After (Educational Style):**
```markdown
## Understanding Alignment Files: SAM and BAM

### What are SAM/BAM files?
When you align sequencing reads to a reference genome, the results are stored in SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Think of this as a detailed report showing exactly where each read mapped.

### Why two formats?
- **SAM files** are human-readable text files - great for learning and debugging
- **BAM files** are compressed binary versions - essential for real analyses due to size

### With Claude Code:
```
I have SAM files from my alignment. Can you convert them to BAM and create index files?
```

Claude Code will:
1. Convert SAM to BAM using samtools
2. Sort the BAM file by coordinate
3. Create index files (.bai) for fast access
4. Validate the output files
```

### 2. Integration with Claude Code Examples
Every technical concept will include Claude Code usage:

**One-liner Integration Example:**
```markdown
## Converting File Formats

### Traditional Approach:
```bash
# Convert SAM to BAM and sort
samtools view -b input.sam | samtools sort -o output.bam
samtools index output.bam
```

### With Claude Code:
```
Convert my SAM files to sorted, indexed BAM files
```

Claude Code will automatically:
- Handle the pipeline correctly
- Add error checking
- Provide progress updates
- Validate the output
```

### 3. Practical Exercise Integration
Transform examples into hands-on learning:

```markdown
## Practice Exercise: File Format Mastery

### Scenario
You've just received alignment files from a collaborator, but they're in different formats than your pipeline expects.

### Your Task
Use Claude Code to:
1. Identify what file types you have
2. Convert everything to a standardized format
3. Validate that conversions worked correctly

### Solution Approach
```
I have various alignment files in my data/ directory. Can you identify the formats and convert everything to sorted, indexed BAM files?
```

### Learning Objectives
- Understand different alignment formats
- Practice file format conversion
- Learn validation techniques
```
