## üìã **Quick Reference**

### At Every Session Start:
1. **Copy and paste all three context documents** (see templates below)
2. **Describe your analysis goal** in natural language
3. **Reference specific sections** during analysis
4. **Save successful workflows** for future use

## üìö **Context Document Templates**

### **Session Start Template** (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
I'm working on bioinformatics analysis. Let me provide you with domain-specific context documents to help you understand the tools, file formats, and best practices in computational biology.

DOCUMENT 1: BIOINFORMATICS CONTEXT REFERENCE
===========================================
[Paste entire content of bioinformatics-context-reference-guide.md here]

DOCUMENT 2: BIOINFORMATICS ONE-LINERS
====================================

Now I'm ready to discuss my bioinformatics analysis needs with full context.
```

### **Targeted Context Template** (For Specific Analyses)

```
I'm working on [RNA-seq/variant calling/quality control] analysis. Here's the relevant bioinformatics context:

RELEVANT SECTIONS FROM CONTEXT DOCUMENTS:

```

### **2. bioinformatics-one-liners.md**

**Primary Purpose**: Provides specific command examples and patterns

**Key Sections by Task**:
- File conversions: Lines 406-421
- Quality control: Lines 423-434  
- Alignment: Lines 436-451
- Variant calling: Lines 453-465
- Text processing: Lines 467-500

**Usage Pattern**:
```
"Using the one-liner examples I provided, help me convert SAM files to sorted BAM files."

"Based on the text processing patterns in my context, extract specific columns from this VCF file."
```

## üîÑ **Progressive Context Strategies**

### **Strategy 1: Full Context (Recommended for Complex Analyses)**
Provide all three documents at session start for comprehensive assistance.

**Best for**:
- New analysis pipelines
- Complex multi-step workflows  
- Training new team members
- Troubleshooting difficult problems

### **Strategy 2: Targeted Context (For Focused Tasks)**
Provide specific sections relevant to your immediate task.

**Best for**:
- Quick file conversions
- Specific tool usage questions
- Parameter optimization
- Debugging specific steps

### **Strategy 3: Reference Context (For Ongoing Sessions)**
Reference previously provided context during the session.

**Example**:
```
"Referring to the quality control standards I provided earlier, what should I do about samples with >30% duplication rate?"
```

## üí° **Effective Context Phrases**

### **Starting a Session**:
- "I'm working on bioinformatics analysis. Here are my context documents..."
- "Let me provide domain-specific context for computational biology..."
- "Here's comprehensive bioinformatics reference material to guide our analysis..."

### **Referencing During Analysis**:
- "Based on the file format guide I provided..."
- "According to the quality standards in my context..."
- "Using the tool recommendations from my reference documents..."
- "Following the workflow patterns I shared..."

### **For Complex Decisions**:
- "Given the context documents I provided, what's the best approach for..."
- "Considering the standards and tools in my reference materials..."
- "Based on all the bioinformatics context I've shared..."

## üéØ **Context Optimization Tips**

### **1. Highlight Relevant Sections**
When providing context, emphasize sections most relevant to your task:

```
I'm working on RNA-seq analysis. Here are my context documents, with RNA-seq sections particularly relevant:

[Full context documents]

Please pay special attention to:
- RNA-seq tools and workflows
- Quality control standards for RNA-seq
- File format handling for sequencing data
```

### **2. Provide Analysis-Specific Context**
Include details about your specific analysis:

```
Context for my analysis:
- Species: Human (GRCh38)
- Data: Paired-end RNA-seq, 50M reads per sample
- Goal: Differential expression between treatment/control
- Available tools: [list your installed software]

[Context documents follow...]
```

### **3. Update Context as Needed**
If analysis requirements change during the session:

```
"My analysis requirements have evolved. Now I also need to [new requirement]. Based on the context I provided, how should I modify the workflow?"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Quality Assurance with Context**

### **Validation Questions to Ask**:
- "Does this workflow follow the best practices outlined in my context documents?"
- "Are these parameters consistent with the quality standards I provided?"
- "Based on my context reference, are there any steps I'm missing?"
- "Do these file formats align with the standards in my documentation?"

### **Cross-Reference Checks**:
- Compare suggested tools against your context document recommendations
- Verify quality thresholds match provided standards
- Ensure workflow patterns follow established best practices
- Confirm file formats are appropriate for downstream analysis

## üìä **Measuring Context Effectiveness**

### **Signs Your Context is Working Well**:
‚úÖ Claude Code suggests appropriate tools for your data type  
‚úÖ Recommended parameters align with published best practices  
‚úÖ Workflow steps follow logical bioinformatics progression  
‚úÖ Quality control suggestions match field standards  
‚úÖ File format recommendations are suitable for downstream analysis  

### **Signs You Need Better Context**:
‚ùå Suggestions seem generic rather than bioinformatics-specific  
‚ùå Recommended tools don't match your analysis type  
‚ùå Quality thresholds seem arbitrary or inappropriate  
‚ùå Workflow steps are missing important bioinformatics considerations  
‚ùå File format suggestions don't align with field standards  

---

## üîÑ **Context Maintenance**

### **Regular Updates**:
- **Monthly**: Review context documents for outdated information
- **New Projects**: Add project-specific context to standard documents
- **Tool Updates**: Include new tools and version changes
- **Standards Evolution**: Update quality thresholds and best practices

### **Team Synchronization**:
- **Shared Context**: Ensure all team members use consistent context documents
- **Local Additions**: Add lab-specific protocols and standards
- **Version Control**: Track changes to context documents
- **Training**: Update new team member onboarding with current context

---

## üìû **Troubleshooting Context Issues**

### **Problem**: Claude Code doesn't seem to understand bioinformatics concepts
**Solution**: Ensure you've provided the full bioinformatics-context-reference-guide.md

### **Problem**: Suggested workflows don't follow best practices
**Solution**: Emphasize the quality standards sections in your context

### **Problem**: Tool recommendations aren't appropriate
**Solution**: Highlight relevant tool sections and specify your available software

### **Problem**: File format suggestions are incorrect
**Solution**: Reference specific file format sections when asking questions
