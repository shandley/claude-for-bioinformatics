â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore                 # Include .claude/settings.local.json
â””â”€â”€ [your project files]
```

### Dotfiles Management
Store Claude Code configurations in your dotfiles repository:

```bash
# Add to dotfiles
~/.claude/settings.json
~/.claude/commands/
```

Link dotfiles in new environments:
```bash
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.claude/commands ~/.claude/commands
```

## Advanced Techniques

### MCP Server Integration
**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** extends Claude Code with additional tools.

#### Popular MCP Servers:
- **Filesystem:** File system operations
- **Puppeteer:** Browser automation and screenshots
- **Brave Search:** Web search capabilities
- **GitHub:** Repository operations
- **Sentry:** Error monitoring integration

#### MCP Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "puppeteer": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"]
    },
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Automation & Headless Mode
For CI/CD integration and automation:

```bash
# Headless mode with prompt
claude -p "Fix all linting errors" --output-format json

# Stream JSON output for real-time processing
claude -p "Analyze test coverage" --output-format stream-json

# Bypass permissions for automation
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p "Run tests and commit fixes"
```

### Advanced Workflow Patterns

#### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Ask Claude to write failing tests first
2. Implement code to make tests pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Claude excels at this pattern

#### Visual Development Workflow
1. Provide design mockups (drag & drop images)
2. Ask Claude to implement the design
3. Use Puppeteer MCP for screenshots
4. Iterate until design matches exactly

#### Subagent Pattern
For complex problems, use subagents:
```
Create a subagent to analyze the database schema and suggest optimizations.
Then create another subagent to review the security implications.
```

## Team Collaboration

### Shared Project Setup
1. **Check in essential files:**
   - `.claude/settings.json` (project settings)
   - `.claude/commands/` (shared commands)
   - `CLAUDE.md` (project documentation)
   - `.mcp.json` (MCP server configuration)

2. **Git ignore personal files:**
   ```gitignore
   .claude/settings.local.json
   ```

3. **Document team conventions in CLAUDE.md:**
   - Code style preferences
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment procedures
   - Common commands and workflows

### Team Naming Conventions
Add personality to your team's CLAUDE.md files:
- Choose fun codenames for team members
- Create engaging, memorable project personas
- Example: "When you need help, ask MR BEEF" or "Harp Dog knows best"

### Shared Commands Library
Create a library of useful commands that benefit the entire team:

**Common Team Commands:**
- `/project:deploy` - Deployment procedures
- `/project:test-full` - Complete test suite
- `/project:security-scan` - Security review
- `/project:performance-check` - Performance analysis
- `/project:docs-update` - Documentation updates

## Troubleshooting & Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

#### Use /clear Frequently
AI agents become unpredictable with long conversations:
```bash
/clear  # Use this often, especially when switching tasks
```

#### Manage Context Window
```bash
/compact  # Summarize conversation to reduce token usage
```

#### Auto-Accept Edits
Enable auto-accept for routine tasks:
```bash
# Press Shift+Tab twice to enable auto-accept mode
# Useful for: linting fixes, formatting, routine refactoring
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Command not found" errors
- Ensure Claude Code is in your PATH
- Check global npm installation
- Verify authentication status

#### Hidden files not appearing with @ shortcut
- Known limitation: dotfiles (.env, .github) don't show in @ completion
- Use explicit file paths as workaround

#### Slow performance on large edits
- Break down large tasks into smaller chunks
- Use /clear to start fresh conversations
- Consider using subagents for complex multi-part tasks

#### Permission prompts
- Use `/permissions` to manage domain allowlists
- Consider `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for trusted automation

### Security Considerations

#### Safe Usage Patterns:
- Review all code changes before accepting
- Use auto-accept only for trusted, routine operations
- Regularly audit generated code for security issues
- Implement pre-commit hooks for additional validation

#### Sensitive Data:
- Never include API keys or secrets in CLAUDE.md
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Review commits to ensure no sensitive data was included

## Cost Optimization

### Token Management Strategies

#### Efficient Conversation Patterns:
1. **Start fresh frequently** - Use `/clear` to avoid token accumulation
2. **Be specific** - Precise prompts reduce back-and-forth
3. **Use /compact** - Summarize long conversations
4. **Batch similar tasks** - Complete related work in single sessions

#### Model Selection:
- **Primary model:** Claude 3.7+ or Claude 4 for complex reasoning
- **Haiku model:** Used automatically for lightweight operations
- Monitor usage through your Anthropic console

#### Cost-Effective Practices:
```bash
# Use headless mode for automation (no interactive tokens)
claude -p "Fix lint errors" --output-format json

# Batch file operations
Read all TypeScript files and suggest consistency improvements

# Use CLAUDE.md to provide context once rather than repeatedly
```

### Monitoring Usage
- Check Anthropic Console for token usage
- Set up spending alerts if available
- Average estimated cost: ~$6/day for typical usage
