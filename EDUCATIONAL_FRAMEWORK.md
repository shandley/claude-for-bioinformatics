## Pedagogical Approach Overview

This document defines the educational philosophy, learning progression design, and instructional strategies for the Claude for Bioinformatics resource.

---

## Core Educational Principles

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
**Concept**: Introduce complexity gradually, building on established foundations.

**Implementation**:
- **Beginner**: Start with single-step commands and immediate results
- **Intermediate**: Combine multiple steps into workflows
- **Advanced**: Design complex, multi-stage analysis pipelines

**Example Progression**:
```
Level 1: "Run quality control on this FASTQ file"
Level 2: "Create a custom command that runs QC on all files in a directory"  
Level 3: "Design a complete preprocessing pipeline with automated decision-making"
```

### 2. Learning by Doing
**Concept**: Hands-on experience with immediate feedback and real results.

**Implementation**:
- **Copy-paste ready examples** that work immediately
- **Real datasets** (or realistic simulated data) for all exercises
- **Immediate visual feedback** through plots and reports
- **Error troubleshooting** as part of the learning process

### 3. Contextual Learning
**Concept**: Connect technical skills to real research scenarios and scientific questions.

**Implementation**:
- **Research scenarios**: "You just received RNA-seq data from a cancer study..."
- **Decision points**: When to use different tools and why
- **Interpretation skills**: What results mean for biological understanding
- **Publication readiness**: Outputs suitable for papers and presentations

### 4. Scaffolded Independence
**Concept**: Gradually reduce guidance while building autonomous problem-solving skills.

**Progression**:
- **Guided walkthrough** → **Structured practice** → **Independent application** → **Creative problem-solving**
