## 🎯 What You'll Learn
- ✅ Set up bioinformatics tools in the cloud (part of the learning!)
- ✅ Analyze real RNA-seq data with industry-standard software
- ✅ Generate publication-quality quality control reports
- ✅ Interpret results like a professional bioinformatician
- ✅ Download results to continue on your own computer

## ⏱️ Tutorial Details
- **Time**: 30-45 minutes
- **Requirements**: Google account (you probably have one!)
- **Cost**: Completely free
- **Downloads**: Take your results with you

## 🌟 Why This Approach?

### ✅ **Advantages of Cloud Learning**
- **No software installation** - Start learning immediately
- **Everything just works** - Pre-configured environment
- **Real tools** - Same software used in professional labs
- **Take results with you** - Download everything when done
- **Learn installation** - See how tools are set up (educational!)

### 🆚 **vs Traditional Installation**
| Traditional Approach | Cloud Approach |
|---------------------|----------------|
| 30-60 min setup time | Start immediately |
| Platform compatibility issues | Works everywhere |
| Version conflicts | Pre-tested environment |
| "It works on my machine" | Identical for everyone |
| Storage space required | No local storage needed |

## 🔄 Transition to Local Development

After completing the cloud tutorial, you'll be ready to:
1. **Set up Claude Code locally** using our [installation guide](../../claude-code-best-practices.md)
2. **Use the complete SOP** for [production workflows](../../Claude_Code_Bioinformatics_SOP.md)
3. **Apply skills to your research data** with confidence

## 🧬 About the Sample Data

We use realistic but small RNA-seq data that:
- **Processes quickly** - Analysis completes in under 2 minutes
- **Shows real patterns** - Same quality issues you'll see in research
- **Teaches interpretation** - Perfect for learning QC metrics
- **Educational contamination** - Includes realistic adapter content for learning
