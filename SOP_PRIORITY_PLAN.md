# SOP Priority Plan: Claude Code for Bioinformatics

## Core Focus: Immediate Practical Value

**Primary Goal**: Create a standalone Standard Operating Procedure that bioinformaticians can implement today to improve their computational workflows using Claude Code.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core SOP Components** (Priority 1)

### 1. **Quick Start SOP Guide** (`Claude_Code_Bioinformatics_SOP.md`)
**Target**: Single document that a lab can adopt immediately

**Content Structure**:
```markdown
# Claude Code for Bioinformatics - Lab SOP

## Setup Checklist (15 minutes)
- [ ] Install Claude Code
- [ ] Configure authentication  
- [ ] Set up project CLAUDE.md with bio context
- [ ] Test with sample analysis

## Daily Workflow Pattern
1. Provide context documents at start of session
2. Use natural language to describe analysis goals
3. Review and validate all generated code
4. Document successful workflows as custom commands

## Essential Context Documents to Provide
- Bioinformatics file formats reference
- Tool installation and usage guide  
- Quality control standards
- One-liners and common commands

## Safety and Validation Protocols
- Always review generated code before execution
- Test on small datasets first
- Maintain analysis logs
- Use version control for all workflows
```

### 2. **Context Document Library** (`context-documents/`)
**Target**: Ready-to-use documents for providing Claude Code with domain knowledge

**Immediate Value Documents**:
- `bioinformatics-formats-reference.md` - File formats and structures
- `tools-and-commands-reference.md` - Common tools and usage patterns
- `quality-control-standards.md` - QC thresholds and best practices
- `common-workflows-patterns.md` - Standard analysis approaches

### 3. **Workflow Templates** (`workflow-templates/`)
**Target**: Copy-paste project setups

**Essential Templates**:
- `RNA-seq-project-template/` - Complete project structure with CLAUDE.md
- `variant-calling-template/` - Population genomics setup
- `QC-analysis-template/` - Quality control workflow
- `custom-commands-template/` - Slash command examples

## ðŸš€ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1A: SOP Foundation** (Week 1)
**Deliverable**: Working SOP that a lab can implement immediately

1. **Single-page SOP guide** - Complete workflow from setup to analysis
2. **Essential context documents** - The 3 existing .md files optimized for Claude Code consumption
3. **Quick start templates** - 2-3 project templates with CLAUDE.md examples
4. **Validation checklist** - Safety and quality assurance protocols

### **Phase 1B: Refinement** (Week 2)  
**Deliverable**: Tested and validated SOP based on real usage

1. **Real-world testing** - Use SOP for actual analyses
2. **Feedback integration** - Refine based on practical experience
3. **Documentation polish** - Clear, concise instructions
4. **Distribution preparation** - Ready for community sharing

### **Phase 2: Educational Expansion** (Weeks 3+)
**Deliverable**: Full educational site building on proven SOP foundation

*Only after the core SOP is validated and working*

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core SOP Content Focus**

### **Context Document Optimization**
Transform your existing documents for optimal Claude Code consumption:

**Current State**: Technical reference documents
**SOP State**: Claude Code context documents with usage instructions

**Example Enhancement**:
```markdown
# How to Use This Document with Claude Code

## At Session Start:
Provide this context by saying:
"I'm working on bioinformatics analysis. Here's my context document for file formats and tools."
[Paste the entire document]

## During Analysis:
Reference specific sections:
"Based on the file formats context I provided, what's the best way to convert these SAM files?"

## Key Sections for Claude Code:
- File Formats (lines 17-91): For format conversion and validation
- Software Tools (lines 94-188): For tool selection and integration  
- Quality Control Standards (lines 360-401): For QC workflows
```

### **Immediate Value Examples**
Real scenarios that work today:

**Scenario 1: New Dataset QC**
```
SOP Step: Provide bioinformatics context document
Ask: "I just received FASTQ files from sequencing. Walk me through quality control analysis."
Result: Complete QC workflow with FastQC, MultiQC, and interpretation
```

**Scenario 2: Pipeline Automation**
```
SOP Step: Reference workflow patterns document  
Ask: "Create a custom command for my RNA-seq differential expression workflow"
Result: Reusable slash command with all steps automated
```

**Scenario 3: Tool Integration**
```
SOP Step: Provide tools reference document
Ask: "I need to integrate STAR alignment with DESeq2 analysis"
Result: Complete pipeline connecting tools with proper file handling
```
