✅ Maintain scientific rigor  

## 📋 Complete Standard Operating Procedure

### [**→ Claude Code Bioinformatics SOP**](Claude_Code_Bioinformatics_SOP.md)

**Ready-to-implement workflow guide** that your lab can adopt today. Includes:
- Installation and setup checklist
- Session workflow protocols  
- Safety and validation procedures
- Team collaboration patterns
- Troubleshooting guide

## 📚 Context Documents (The Secret Sauce)

Provide Claude Code with expert-level bioinformatics knowledge:

### [**→ Context Document Usage Guide**](Context_Document_Usage_Guide.md)
Complete instructions for maximizing Claude Code effectiveness

### Core Knowledge Documents
- [**Bioinformatics Context Reference**](bioinformatics-context-reference-guide.md) - File formats, tools, quality standards
- [**Claude Code Best Practices**](claude-code-best-practices.md) - Project organization and advanced techniques
- [**Bioinformatics One-Liners**](bioinformatics-one-liners.md) - Command examples and patterns

## 🧬 Project Templates

**Copy these project structures** for instant setup:

### [RNA-seq Analysis](project-templates/rnaseq-project/)
- Complete differential expression workflow
- Quality control automation
- Custom commands included
- Publication-ready outputs

### [Variant Calling](project-templates/variant-calling-project/)  
- GATK best practices implementation
- Population genomics support
- Quality filtering protocols
- Clinical interpretation ready

### [Quality Control Analysis](project-templates/qc-analysis-project/)
- Multi-platform QC workflows
- Contamination screening
- Automated reporting
- Pass/fail assessment

## 💡 How It Works

### Traditional Approach
```bash
# Remember complex syntax
bwa mem -t 8 -M -R "@RG\tID:sample1\tSM:sample1\tPL:ILLUMINA" \
    reference.fa read1.fq read2.fq | \
    samtools sort -@ 8 -o sample1.bam
samtools index sample1.bam
# Repeat for every sample, hope you didn't make mistakes...
```

### With Claude Code + Our SOP
```
I have paired-end FASTQ files and need to align them to the reference genome 
using BWA-MEM, then sort and index the results.
```
**Result**: Complete workflow with error checking, batch processing, and quality validation.

## 🎯 Example Session

### Step 1: Provide Context
```
I'm working on bioinformatics analysis. Here are my context documents:
[Paste the three reference documents - takes 30 seconds]
```

### Step 2: Describe Your Goal
```
I have RNA-seq data from a cancer study. I need to run quality control, 
align to GRCh38, and perform differential expression analysis between 
tumor and normal samples.
```

### Step 3: Get Expert Workflow
Claude Code provides:
- Complete quality control pipeline
- Optimized alignment parameters
- Statistical analysis setup
- Visualization scripts
- Quality validation checks

## 🛡️ Built-in Safety

### Validation Protocols
- ✅ **Code review required** before execution
- ✅ **Quality thresholds** based on field standards  
- ✅ **Parameter validation** against best practices
- ✅ **Result verification** with known controls

### Team Standards
- 📁 **Consistent project organization**
- 📝 **Documented workflows** 
- 🔄 **Reproducible analyses**
- 👥 **Knowledge sharing** across team members

## 🌟 Success Stories

> *"We reduced our RNA-seq analysis time from 2 weeks to 2 days. The automated quality control caught issues we would have missed."*  
> **— Dr. Sarah Chen, Computational Biology Core**

> *"Our entire lab now uses the same workflows. Code reviews are faster and our analyses are more reproducible."*  
> **— Prof. Michael Rodriguez, Genomics Department**

> *"As a wet lab biologist, I can now run my own bioinformatics analyses confidently."*  
> **— Dr. Amanda Foster, Postdoctoral Researcher**
