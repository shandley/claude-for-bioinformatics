## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Learning Modules (Weeks 1-4)
- Create Modules 1.1-1.3 with test datasets
- Develop hands-on exercises with expected outputs
- Test with volunteer users for feedback
- Iterate based on user experience

### Phase 2: Advanced Content (Weeks 5-8)
- Build Modules 2.1-2.3 with realistic datasets
- Create video demonstrations for complex concepts
- Develop assessment/validation exercises
- Expand troubleshooting guides

### Phase 3: Community Features (Weeks 9-12)

- Set up community contribution workflows
- Create example galleries and showcase
- Enable user-generated content sharing

## Content Development Principles

### 1. Real Data, Real Results
- Use actual bioinformatics datasets (appropriately sized)
- Show realistic analysis outputs and interpretation
- Include common data quality issues and solutions
- Demonstrate publication-ready result generation

### 2. Progressive Complexity
- Each level builds on previous knowledge
- Clear prerequisites and learning objectives
- Optional advanced sections for deeper exploration
- Multiple pathways for different research focuses

### 3. Immediate Applicability
- Every exercise produces useful outputs
