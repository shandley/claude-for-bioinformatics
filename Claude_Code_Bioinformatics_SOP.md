# Claude Code for Bioinformatics - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview

This SOP provides a standardized approach for using Claude Code to enhance bioinformatics workflows. By following these procedures, you'll leverage AI assistance while maintaining scientific rigor and reproducibility.

**Time to implement**: 30 seconds (automated setup)  
**Immediate benefits**: Zero-friction context loading, instant project creation, consistent workflows

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Checklist (30 seconds)

### Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# One command installs everything globally
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shandley/claude-for-bioinformatics/master/setup.sh | bash

# Create your first project
claude-bio new rnaseq my-analysis
cd my-analysis

# Start Claude with automatic context loading
claude
```

‚úÖ **Setup Complete** - Context documents automatically loaded, ready for analysis!

### Manual Setup (Legacy Approach)
If you prefer manual setup or the automated script doesn't work:

```bash
# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/shandley/claude-for-bioinformatics.git
cd claude-for-bioinformatics

# Follow manual context loading procedures below
```

## üìã Standard Workflow Protocol

### Every Analysis Session Protocol

#### 1. **Context Automatically Loaded** (After Setup)
With the automated setup, bioinformatics context is automatically available!

**Automated Approach (Recommended):**
- Context documents are automatically loaded when you start Claude in any project
- No copy-pasting required
- Always up-to-date with latest versions

**Manual Approach (Legacy):**
If using manual setup, at the beginning of each Claude Code session:
```
I'm working on bioinformatics analysis. Let me provide you with domain-specific context documents to help you understand the tools, file formats, and best practices.

[Paste content from context documents - see Context Document Usage section]
```

#### 2. **Define Your Analysis Goal** (Natural Language)
Instead of trying to remember command syntax, describe what you want to accomplish:

**Good Examples**:
- "I have paired-end RNA-seq FASTQ files and need to run quality control analysis"
- "Convert these SAM files to sorted, indexed BAM files"
- "Run differential expression analysis comparing treatment vs control samples"
- "Create a variant calling pipeline following GATK best practices"

#### 3. **Review Generated Code** (Critical Safety Step)
**ALWAYS review code before execution**:
- ‚úÖ Check file paths are correct
- ‚úÖ Verify parameters make sense for your data
- ‚úÖ Ensure output directories exist
- ‚úÖ Validate that commands match your research goals

#### 4. **Execute and Validate Results**
- Run code on small test datasets first
- Check intermediate outputs
- Validate final results against known standards
- Document successful workflows for future use

#### 5. **Save Successful Workflows** (Reproducibility)
Create custom commands for repeated analyses:
```
/save-workflow "rna-seq-qc" 
# Saves the successful workflow as a reusable command
```

## üìö Context Document Usage

### Essential Context Documents
Always provide these documents at session start:

#### 1. **Bioinformatics Context Reference** (Core Domain Knowledge)
```
File: bioinformatics-context-reference-guide.md
Usage: Provides Claude Code with understanding of:
- File formats (FASTQ, BAM, VCF, etc.)
- Software tools and their applications
- Quality control standards
- Best practices and conventions
```

#### 2. **Claude Code Best Practices** (Tool Usage Patterns)
```
File: claude-code-best-practices.md  
Usage: Teaches Claude Code how to:
- Structure bioinformatics projects
- Create effective custom commands
- Integrate with existing workflows
- Optimize for team collaboration
```

#### 3. **Bioinformatics One-Liners** (Command Examples)
```
File: bioinformatics-one-liners.md
Usage: Provides examples of:
- Common file manipulations
- Text processing patterns
- Quick analysis commands
- Troubleshooting approaches
```

### How to Provide Context Documents

**Option 1: Full Context (Recommended for new sessions)**
```
Here are my bioinformatics context documents:

[Paste entire content of bioinformatics-context-reference-guide.md]

[Paste entire content of claude-code-best-practices.md]

[Paste entire content of bioinformatics-one-liners.md]
```

**Option 2: Selective Context (For specific tasks)**
```
I'm working on RNA-seq analysis. Here's the relevant context:

[Paste RNA-seq sections from context documents]
```

**Option 3: Reference Context (For ongoing sessions)**
```
Please refer to the bioinformatics context I provided earlier about [specific topic]
```

**Solution**:
```
"The analysis failed due to memory limitations. Please modify the workflow to use less memory or process data in smaller batches."
```

#### File format issues
**Cause**: Unexpected file formats or corruption
**Solution**:
```
"I'm getting file format errors. Please analyze these files and recommend preprocessing steps or format conversions."
```

#### Analysis parameter questions
**Cause**: Uncertainty about appropriate parameters
**Solution**:
```
"Based on the context documents provided, what are the recommended parameters for [specific analysis] with [data type]?"
```
